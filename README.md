# Save Point

Save Point is a template blog about video games built with React and Next.js.

## What problem does it solve?

It provides a simple and quick way to upload and display blog posts written in Markdown documents.

## Project Goal

The primary goal was to practice React by building something useful and interesting. By creating this blog, I learned more about React components and React hooks, which I can explore in future projects.
